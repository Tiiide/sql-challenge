Homework for Module 9 - SQL


For this module, we are given 6 CSV files with data that we need to convert to tables in a SQL database and perform analysis of the data once converted.

quickdatabasediagrams.com was used to create the initial table structure and ERD which was then used to create the database tables in PostgreSQL.

Next, the CSV files were imported into the corresponding database table using the Import Data tool in PostgreSQL.

With all data imported, the SQL queries were structured and created within the PostgreSQL Query Tool. Each question has been added above each query in a commented line for clarity.
